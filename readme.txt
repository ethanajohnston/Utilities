This script, which is called "TextToCSVConverter", reads data from an input text file, processes it, and writes the output to a CSV file. It defines a function split_into_columns() to split each line in the input file into columns based on whitespace. The script also changes the working directory to the script's directory, ensuring that the input and output files are read and written from the correct location. It also prints a message to the console, indicating that the processing is complete and the resulting CSV file has been saved.

I used it for formatting a bunch of S parameters of a transistor from a provided .dat file into data which can be used in matlab.
